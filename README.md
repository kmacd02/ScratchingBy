A short and sweet game made for Ludum Dare 51, a 72 hour game jam hackathon.
--
Serve drinks and pastries to a lovable cast of cats! Make sure to always have pastries on hand, and be careful not to take too long with the drinks.  Someone new comes through the door every ten seconds. Good luck!

How-To-Play:
--
To make tea: Drag a cup to your workspace, add a tea base, and then add mixtures and toppings accordingly. Drag the finished order to the customer to complete, or to the trash in the corner to start over!

To make coffee: Drag a mug to the coffee machine, and select your roast. Grab ice to make the drink cold and/or add creamer or caramel as requested by your kitty customer.

To make a pastry: Grab pastry mix from the drawer, drag it to the oven, and voila! Pastries will be available to serve to customers. Remember, it takes longer to bake pastries than the customer is willing to wait, so be sure to have some on hand!
